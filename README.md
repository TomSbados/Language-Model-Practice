# The Goal

The aim of this project was to learn more about the creation and implementation of machine learning in language models. Frameworks used were Pytorch as well as the TikToken library from OpenAI.

Bigram.ipynb --- Basic bigram model (test TikToken set up conda on MPS)

Trigram.ipynb --- trigram model with transformer architecture
